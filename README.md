Haskell Pengines v.0.0.1
# This is the basic Pengines interface for Haskell.
It aims to provide a simple API for Haskell integration with SWI-Prolog's Pengines.

## To Do:
We are currently working on...
- Basic implementation of interface.
- Get a prototype working. COMPLETED
- Model the datatypes.  Ensure relevant datatypes are serializable.
- Necessary datatypes include Prolog Data Types, Header Data (Sent), Header Data (Received), Query Data, Server Data, along with default values for each.
